  <p class="lead"><em>Hi</em>. My name is Allison, and I'm a full-stack Web Developer.</p>
  <p class="text-muted">I graduated from General Assembly’s full-time Web Development Immersive Bootcamp, and have returned to General Assembly as a "Developer In Residence" to assist the instructional team as a TA.  I have experience running events as a volunteer, and working at retail stores, primarily shipping and receiving.  I also have a background in collectible product design, promotional toy design, retail toy design, and illustration development.</p>
  <p class="text-muted">I love creating things, and seeing them happen.  I chose General Assembly, because I enjoy learning how to solve interesting problems, and wanted a career path that will require continual learning.  I’m looking for a role on a team developing interesting new web solutions.</p>
